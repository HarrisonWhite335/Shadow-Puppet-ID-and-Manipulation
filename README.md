# Shadow-Puppet-ID-and-Manipulation
This reposirtory is for the code and documentation needed for idefyting shadows produced by a hand and manipulating said hand.
In order to get the identifier working, please use download all .py files into the same working folder then run step_3. After running step_3 run step_5 to allow your computer's
camera to see the sign letter and properly identify it. Try to make the background as blank as possible with the hand taking up most of the screen but still being contained
within the resolution borders.
